This program will recursively unrar rar files to the (sub)directory in which they reside.
This means it will jump through every rar in a given directory (and it's subdirectories) and unrar it to where it resides.
Usage:  ./rarcursive [directory (required)] [delete (optional)]

Requirements: unrar, egrep, and find (can you tell im trying to make it seem like my stuff is more intense and needs more stuff to work right...)
